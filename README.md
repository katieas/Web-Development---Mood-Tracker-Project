# Mood Tracker Project

This is my Final Project titled "Mood Tracker" for my **CPSC 314 Web Development** Class during Fall 2021.
Users are able to create and login to an account where they are able to keep a log of their emotions. They can create a new Entry for logging their mood and view their previous entries associated to their account. There is also a button where a user can generate a random joke.

This is an Emotional Health based web app. I want people to know it is okay to be emotional and hope that this web project will help them better understand their emotions and feel better about themselves.

This is a full stack web project using a variation of the MEAN technology stack. I used HTML, CSS, JQuery for the Front end. In the back end I used Node.js and Express and MongoDB as my database.
